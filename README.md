# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradient rendering when there's a significant difference between the `from` and `to` colors in a linear gradient.  Some browsers might not handle the transition smoothly, leading to banding or visual artifacts.

## Problem

The `bug.html` file shows an example where the gradient between blue and purple, while visually striking, can result in uneven color transitions in certain browsers.  This isn't a bug in Tailwind itself, but rather a limitation in how browsers render complex gradients.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a few potential solutions:

* **Using intermediary colors:**  Adding intermediate colors to the gradient can help the browser create smoother transitions.
* **Adjusting color contrast:** Reducing the contrast between the `from` and `to` colors will often improve rendering.
* **Using a different gradient type:**  If the linear gradient continues to have issues, consider using a `radial-gradient` for a different visual effect that might render better.

This issue highlights the importance of testing your gradients across multiple browsers and adjusting colors to ensure consistent rendering across platforms.
